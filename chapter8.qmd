title: "Gradient Descent: Optimization in Machine Learning"
---


Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm in machine learning used to minimize a cost function by iteratively adjusting model parameters. It's the engine that powers many machine learning algorithms, from simple linear regression to complex neural networks.

At its core, gradient descent is based on a simple yet powerful idea: to find the minimum of a function, we can follow the direction of the steepest descent. Mathematically, this direction is given by the negative gradient of the function.

## The Intuition Behind Gradient Descent

Think of gradient descent as descending a mountain in foggy conditions where you can only see a small area around you. To reach the bottom (the minimum), you:

1. Feel the ground around you to determine the steepest downward direction (calculate the gradient)
2. Take a step in that direction (update parameters)
3. Repeat until you reach a point where all directions lead upward (convergence)

The cost function represents the "mountain landscape" in this analogy, with its valleys corresponding to low error and its peaks to high error.

## Mathematical Foundation

For a function J(θ), where θ represents our model parameters, the gradient ∇J(θ) points in the direction of the steepest increase. Therefore, to minimize J(θ), we update θ as follows:

θ = θ - α·∇J(θ)

Where:
- α is the learning rate (step size)
- ∇J(θ) is the gradient of the cost function with respect to parameters θ

For a linear regression problem with mean squared error (MSE) cost function, this translates to:

∇J(θ) = (1/m) · X^T · (X·θ - y)

Where:
- m is the number of training examples
- X is the feature matrix
- y is the target vector
- θ is the parameter vector

## How Gradient Descent Works

Gradient Descent operates through a systematic process:

1. **Random Initialization**: Begin with arbitrary parameter values. This represents our starting point on the "mountain."
2. **Calculate the Gradient**: Compute the gradient (slope) of the cost function with respect to each parameter. This tells us which direction leads downhill most steeply.
3. **Update Parameters**: Adjust parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient. The size of this adjustment is controlled by the learning rate.
4. **Repeat Until Convergence**: Continue until the gradient approaches zero, indicating a minimum.

The algorithm's success hinges on the learning rate, which controls the step size in each iteration.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate a simple regression dataset
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=10, random_state=42)
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)
y = y.reshape(-1, 1)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Implement basic gradient descent for linear regression
def gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000):
    # Initialize parameters (weights and bias)
    m = X.shape[0]
    theta = np.zeros((2, 1))  # [w, b]
    X_b = np.c_[np.ones((m, 1)), X]  # Add intercept term
    
    # To store cost history
    cost_history = []
    
    for i in range(iterations):
        # Calculate predictions
        predictions = X_b.dot(theta)
        
        # Calculate error
        error = predictions - y
        
        # Calculate gradients
        gradients = (1/m) * X_b.T.dot(error)
        
        # Update parameters
        theta = theta - learning_rate * gradients
        
        # Calculate cost (MSE)
        cost = (1/(2*m)) * np.sum(np.square(error))
        cost_history.append(cost)
        
    return theta, cost_history

# Run gradient descent
theta, cost_history = gradient_descent(X_train, y_train)

# Visualize cost over iterations
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(cost_history)
plt.xlabel('Iterations')
plt.ylabel('Cost')
plt.title('Cost vs. Iterations')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Visualize the regression line

plt.scatter(X_train, y_train, alpha=0.7)
X_new = np.array([[np.min(X_train)], [np.max(X_train)]])
X_new_b = np.c_[np.ones((2, 1)), X_new]
y_predict = X_new_b.dot(theta)
plt.plot(X_new, y_predict, "r-", linewidth=2)

plt.show()

print(f"Optimized parameters: w = {theta[1][0]:.4f}, b = {theta[0][0]:.4f}")
```

## The Learning Rate: A Delicate Balance

The learning rate (α) is a hyperparameter that determines how large each step is during optimization. Its selection involves a fundamental trade-off:

- **Too Small**: Convergence is extremely slow, requiring many iterations. This is computationally inefficient but less likely to miss the minimum.
- **Too Large**: The algorithm overshoots minima, potentially diverging instead of converging. This manifests as increasing cost values over iterations.

An optimal rate ensures steady progress toward the minimum without overshooting. In practice, finding the right learning rate often involves experimentation.

### The Goldilocks Principle in Learning Rates

Think of learning rate selection as the "Goldilocks principle" – not too hot, not too cold, but just right:

1. **"Too cold" (small α)**: The algorithm moves very cautiously, taking tiny steps. While it's unlikely to overshoot, it might take an impractically long time to reach the minimum.
2. **"Too hot" (large α)**: The algorithm takes aggressive steps and might bounce around or completely miss the minimum, potentially even diverging (costs increase).
3. **"Just right" (optimal α)**: The algorithm makes steady progress, converging to the minimum efficiently.

Learning rate scheduling techniques (discussed later) attempt to get the best of both worlds by starting with larger steps and gradually reducing them.

```{python}
def compare_learning_rates(X, y, learning_rates=[0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5], iterations=100):
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
    m = X.shape[0]
    X_b = np.c_[np.ones((m, 1)), X]
    
    for lr in learning_rates:
        theta = np.zeros((2, 1))
        cost_history = []
        
        for i in range(iterations):
            predictions = X_b.dot(theta)
            error = predictions - y
            gradients = (1/m) * X_b.T.dot(error)
            theta = theta - lr * gradients
            cost = (1/(2*m)) * np.sum(np.square(error))
            cost_history.append(cost)

## Challenges in Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent faces several challenges that arise from the nature of optimization landscapes:

### 1. Non-Convex Cost Functions

In many machine learning models, especially neural networks, the cost function isn't convex—meaning it has multiple local minima, saddle points, and plateaus. This creates several challenges:

- **Local Minima**: The algorithm might settle in a suboptimal local minimum rather than finding the global minimum. This is particularly problematic in deep learning.
- **Saddle Points**: Points where the gradient is zero in all directions, but it's neither a maximum nor a minimum. These can slow down convergence significantly.
- **Plateaus**: Flat regions in the cost function where the gradient is close to zero, slowing progress despite being far from a minimum.

### 2. The Ravine Problem

In some cost functions, the surface has elongated valley-like structures (ravines). In these cases, the gradient often points across the ravine rather than along it toward the minimum. This causes the algorithm to oscillate from one side to another, making slow progress.

### 3. Feature Scaling Issues

When features have different scales, the cost function contours become elongated ellipses rather than circles. This creates a similar ravine problem, where the gradient doesn't point directly toward the minimum.

To address this issue, feature scaling techniques like standardization are essential:

```{python}
# Demonstrating the importance of feature scaling
X_multi, y_multi = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=2, noise=10, random_state=42)

# Scale one feature to be much larger
X_multi[:, 1] = X_multi[:, 1] * 100

# Split data
X_train_unscaled, X_test_unscaled, y_train_multi, y_test_multi = train_test_split(
    X_multi, y_multi.reshape(-1, 1), test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Create scaled version
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train_unscaled)

# Run gradient descent on both scaled and unscaled data
def run_gd_experiment(X, y, title, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=500):
    m = X.shape[0]
    n_features = X.shape[1]
    theta = np.zeros((n_features + 1, 1))
    X_b = np.c_[np.ones((m, 1)), X]
    cost_history = []
    
    for i in range(iterations):
        predictions = X_b.dot(theta)
        error = predictions - y
        gradients = (1/m) * X_b.T.dot(error)
        theta = theta - learning_rate * gradients
        cost = (1/(2*m)) * np.sum(np.square(error))
        cost_history.append(cost)
    
    return cost_history

# Compare convergence with and without scaling
cost_unscaled = run_gd_experiment(X_train_unscaled, y_train_multi, "Unscaled")
cost_scaled = run_gd_experiment(X_train_scaled, y_train_multi, "Scaled")

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(cost_unscaled, label='Unscaled Features')
plt.plot(cost_scaled, label='Scaled Features')
plt.xlabel('Iterations')
plt.ylabel('Cost')
plt.title('Impact of Feature Scaling on Convergence')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### 4. Vanishing and Exploding Gradients

In deep neural networks, gradients can either:
- Become extremely small (vanish) as they're propagated backward through many layers
- Become extremely large (explode) in certain network architectures

Both problems hamper effective training. Modern techniques like batch normalization, residual connections, and careful weight initialization help address these issues.

# Types of Gradient Descent

There are three main variants of Gradient Descent, each with its own strengths and use cases. The primary difference is how much data they use to compute each parameter update.

## 1. Batch Gradient Descent

Batch Gradient Descent calculates the gradient using the entire dataset before updating parameters. This ensures consistent steps toward the minimum but can be computationally expensive for large datasets.

### Conceptual Understanding

Think of Batch GD as carefully surveying the entire mountain before taking each step. This provides the most accurate direction but requires significant effort before making any progress.

### Key Properties

- **Deterministic**: Always takes the same path for the same starting point
- **Memory-intensive**: Must process the entire dataset in memory
- **Smooth convergence**: Progress is steady with minimal fluctuations
- **Computationally expensive**: Especially for large datasets

```{python}
def batch_gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000):
    m = X.shape[0]
    n_features = X.shape[1]
    theta = np.zeros((n_features + 1, 1))
    X_b = np.c_[np.ones((m, 1)), X]
    cost_history = []
    
    for i in range(iterations):
        # Use entire dataset for each update
        predictions = X_b.dot(theta)
        error = predictions - y
        gradients = (1/m) * X_b.T.dot(error)
        theta = theta - learning_rate * gradients
        cost = (1/(2*m)) * np.sum(np.square(error))
        cost_history.append(cost)
        
        # Early stopping condition (optional)
        if i > 0 and abs(cost_history[i] - cost_history[i-1]) < 1e-10:
            break
            
    return theta, cost_history
```

## 2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Stochastic Gradient Descent updates parameters using a single randomly selected training instance at each step. This makes it faster and more memory-efficient but introduces more randomness.

### Conceptual Understanding

SGD is like taking quick steps based on whatever small part of the mountain you can immediately see. The direction might not be perfect, but you can take many more steps in the same amount of time.

### Key Properties

- **Randomized**: Takes a different path each time
- **Memory-efficient**: Processes one example at a time
- **Noisy convergence**: Path includes fluctuations and bounces
- **Ability to escape local minima**: Randomness helps jump out of suboptimal valleys
- **Can work with streaming data**: Doesn't need the entire dataset at once

```{python}
def stochastic_gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, epochs=10):
    m = X.shape[0]
    n_features = X.shape[1]
    theta = np.zeros((n_features + 1, 1))
    X_b = np.c_[np.ones((m, 1)), X]
    cost_history = []
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Shuffle data at the beginning of each epoch
        indices = np.random.permutation(m)
        X_shuffled = X_b[indices]
        y_shuffled = y[indices]
        
        for i in range(m):
            # Use a single instance for each update
            xi = X_shuffled[i:i+1]
            yi = y_shuffled[i:i+1]
            
            prediction = xi.dot(theta)
            error = prediction - yi
            gradients = xi.T.dot(error)
            
            # Learning rate scheduling (optional)
            lr = learning_rate / (epoch * m + i + 1)**0.5
            
            theta = theta - lr * gradients
            
        # Calculate cost after each epoch (using full dataset)
        predictions = X_b.dot(theta)
        cost = (1/(2*m)) * np.sum(np.square(predictions - y))
        cost_history.append(cost)
        
    return theta, cost_history
```

### Learning Rate Scheduling in SGD

Learning rate scheduling gradually reduces the learning rate over time, helping SGD settle at a minimum. This combines the benefits of larger initial steps (faster progress) with smaller later steps (precision).

Common scheduling strategies include:

1. **Time-based decay**: α = α₀ / (1 + kt)
2. **Step decay**: α = α₀ × 0.5^(t/τ)
3. **Exponential decay**: α = α₀ × e^(-kt)

Where:
- α₀ is the initial learning rate
- t is the iteration number or epoch
- k and τ are hyperparameters

```{python}
def learning_rate_schedule(initial_lr, epoch, decay_rate=0.01):
    return initial_lr / (1 + decay_rate * epoch)
```

## 3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

Mini-Batch Gradient Descent combines the best of both worlds: it updates parameters using small random subsets (mini-batches) of the training data.

### Conceptual Understanding

This is like surveying a representative sample of the mountain before each step. The direction isn't as precise as Batch GD but is more accurate than SGD, while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Key Properties

- **Semi-randomized**: Less variance than SGD, more than Batch GD
- **Good memory efficiency**: Only needs to process a batch at a time
- **Vectorization-friendly**: Can leverage parallel processing
- **Balance of stability and speed**: Smoother convergence than SGD, faster than Batch GD
- **Industry standard**: Most practical implementations use this approach

```{python}
def mini_batch_gradient_descent(X, y, batch_size=32, learning_rate=0.01, epochs=10):
    m = X.shape[0]
    n_features = X.shape[1]
    theta = np.zeros((n_features + 1, 1))
    X_b = np.c_[np.ones((m, 1)), X]
    cost_history = []
    
    n_batches = int(np.ceil(m / batch_size))
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        # Shuffle data at the beginning of each epoch
        indices = np.random.permutation(m)
        X_shuffled = X_b[indices]
        y_shuffled = y[indices]
        
        for batch in range(n_batches):
            # Calculate batch indices
            start_idx = batch * batch_size
            end_idx = min((batch + 1) * batch_size, m)
            
            # Extract mini-batch
            X_mini = X_shuffled[start_idx:end_idx]
            y_mini = y_shuffled[start_idx:end_idx]
            
            # Update parameters using mini-batch
            predictions = X_mini.dot(theta)
            error = predictions - y_mini
            gradients = (1/len(X_mini)) * X_mini.T.dot(error)
            theta = theta - learning_rate * gradients
        
        # Calculate cost after each epoch (using full dataset)
        predictions = X_b.dot(theta)
        cost = (1/(2*m)) * np.sum(np.square(predictions - y))
        cost_history.append(cost)
        
    return theta, cost_history
```

## Theoretical Understanding of Batch Size Impact

The batch size directly affects:

1. **Gradient estimation quality**: Larger batches provide more accurate gradient estimates
2. **Update frequency**: Smaller batches allow more frequent updates
3. **Generalization performance**: Research suggests very large batches may lead to poorer generalization
4. **Hardware utilization**: Optimal batch sizes leverage hardware parallelism

## Comparison of Gradient Descent Variants

Let's compare all three approaches:

```{python}
def compare_gd_variants(X, y):
    # Prepare data
    m = X.shape[0]
    X_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)
    
    # Run Batch GD
    theta_bgd, cost_bgd = batch_gradient_descent(X_scaled, y, learning_rate=0.1, iterations=100)
    
    # Run SGD
    theta_sgd, cost_sgd = stochastic_gradient_descent(X_scaled, y, learning_rate=0.1, epochs=20)
    
    # Run Mini-batch GD
    theta_mbgd, cost_mbgd = mini_batch_gradient_descent(X_scaled, y, batch_size=16, learning_rate=0.1, epochs=20)
    
    # Visualize convergence
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
    plt.plot(cost_bgd, label='Batch GD')
    plt.plot(range(0, len(cost_sgd) * 5, 5), cost_sgd, label='SGD')  # Adjusted for epoch count
    plt.plot(range(0, len(cost_mbgd) * 5, 5), cost_mbgd, label='Mini-batch GD')  # Adjusted for epoch count
    plt.xlabel('Iterations/Epochs')
    plt.ylabel('Cost')
    plt.title('Convergence Comparison of Gradient Descent Variants')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
    
    return theta_bgd, theta_sgd, theta_mbgd

# Compare all three variants
theta_bgd, theta_sgd, theta_mbgd = compare_gd_variants(X_train, y_train)
```

## When to Use Each Variant

| Algorithm | Large Datasets | Memory Efficiency | Convergence Stability | Use Case |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------|
| Batch GD | Slow | High memory usage | Very stable | Small datasets, need for deterministic solution |
| SGD | Fast | Very efficient | Noisy, may not settle exactly | Very large datasets, online learning |
| Mini-batch GD | Fast | Efficient | Good balance | Most practical applications, especially deep learning |

# Advanced Optimization Techniques

## Beyond Vanilla Gradient Descent

While gradient descent is powerful, several advanced optimization algorithms build upon it to address its limitations:

### 1. Momentum

Momentum adds a "velocity" term that accumulates past gradients, helping overcome:
- Small local variations (noise)
- Plateaus where gradients are small
- The ravine problem by dampening oscillations

The update rule becomes:
v = γv - α∇J(θ)
θ = θ + v

Where:
- v is the velocity vector (initialized to zeros)
- γ is the momentum coefficient (typically 0.9)
- α is the learning rate

Conceptually, momentum is like rolling a ball down the hill – it builds up velocity in consistent directions and dampens oscillations perpendicular to the main direction.

### 2. RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation)

RMSprop adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient magnitudes:

s = βs + (1-β)(∇J(θ))²
θ = θ - α/√(s+ε) * ∇J(θ)

Where:
- s tracks the exponentially weighted average of squared gradients
- β is typically 0.9
- ε is a small value to prevent division by zero

This allows different parameters to have different effective learning rates based on their gradient histories.

### 3. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)

Adam combines ideas from both momentum and RMSprop:

m = β₁m + (1-β₁)∇J(θ)  // First moment (momentum)
v = β₂v + (1-β₂)(∇J(θ))²  // Second moment (RMSprop)
m̂ = m/(1-β₁ᵗ)  // Bias correction
v̂ = v/(1-β₂ᵗ)  // Bias correction
θ = θ - α * m̂/√(v̂+ε)

Where typical values are β₁=0.9, β₂=0.999, and ε=10⁻⁸.

Adam is currently one of the most popular optimization algorithms for deep learning due to its excellent performance across a wide range of problems.

## Regularization

Regularization prevents overfitting by adding a penalty to the cost function based on the size of model parameters. This creates a balance between fitting the training data well and maintaining simpler models.

### L1 Regularization (Lasso)

L1 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of weights, often resulting in sparse models with some coefficients set to zero (feature selection).

J_L1(θ) = J(θ) + α∑|θᵢ|

The gradient includes an additional term: sign(θᵢ) for each parameter.

```{python}
def lasso_gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000, alpha=0.1):
    m = X.shape[0]
    n_features = X.shape[1]
    theta = np.zeros((n_features + 1, 1))
    X_b = np.c_[np.ones((m, 1)), X]
    cost_history = []
    
    for i in range(iterations):
        predictions = X_b.dot(theta)
        error = predictions - y
        
        # Gradient for the intercept (no regularization)
        gradient_intercept = (1/m) * X_b[:, 0:1].T.dot(error)
        
        # Gradient for the weights (with L1 regularization)
        gradients_weights = (1/m) * X_b[:, 1:].T.dot(error) + (alpha/m) * np.sign(theta[1:])
        
        # Update parameters
        theta[0] = theta[0] - learning_rate * gradient_intercept
        theta[1:] = theta[1:] - learning_rate * gradients_weights
        
        # Calculate cost with L1 regularization
        mse = (1/(2*m)) * np.sum(np.square(error))
        l1_penalty = (alpha/m) * np.sum(np.abs(theta[1:]))
        cost = mse + l1_penalty
        cost_history.append(cost)
        
    return theta, cost_history
```

### L2 Regularization (Ridge)

L2 regularization adds a penalty proportional to the square of weights, shrinking all coefficients but rarely setting them to exactly zero.

J_L2(θ) = J(θ) + α∑θᵢ²/2

The gradient includes an additional term: αθᵢ for each parameter.

```{python}
def ridge_gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000, alpha=0.1):
    m = X.shape[0]
    n_features = X.shape[1]
    theta = np.zeros((n_features + 1, 1))
    X_b = np.c_[np.ones((m, 1)), X]
    cost_history = []
    
    for i in range(iterations):
        predictions = X_b.dot(theta)
        error = predictions - y
        
        # Gradient for the intercept (no regularization)
        gradient_intercept = (1/m) * X_b[:, 0:1].T.dot(error)
        
        # Gradient for the weights (with L2 regularization)
        gradients_weights = (1/m) * X_b[:, 1:].T.dot(error) + (alpha/m) * 2 * theta[1:]
        
        # Update parameters
        theta[0] = theta[0] - learning_rate * gradient_intercept
        theta[1:] = theta[1:] - learning_rate * gradients_weights
        
        # Calculate cost with L2 regularization
        mse = (1/(2*m)) * np.sum(np.square(error))
        l2_penalty = (alpha/(2*m)) * np.sum(np.square(theta[1:]))
        cost = mse + l2_penalty
        cost_history.append(cost)
        
    return theta, cost_history
```

### Elastic Net

Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 regularization, providing a balance between the feature selection properties of L1 and the parameter shrinking of L2:

J_EN(θ) = J(θ) + αρ∑|θᵢ| + α(1-ρ)∑θᵢ²/2

Where ρ controls the balance between L1 and L2 penalties.

```{python}
def elastic_net_gradient_descent(X, y, learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000, alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.5):
    m = X.shape[0]
    n_features = X.shape[1]
    theta = np.zeros((n_features + 1, 1))
    X_b = np.c_[np.ones((m, 1)), X]
    cost_history = []
    
    for i in range(iterations):
        predictions = X_b.dot(theta)
        error = predictions - y
        
        # Gradient for the intercept (no regularization)
        gradient_intercept = (1/m) * X_b[:, 0:1].T.dot(error)
        
        # Gradient for the weights (with Elastic Net regularization)
        l1_grad = (alpha/m) * l1_ratio * np.sign(theta[1:])
        l2_grad = (alpha/m) * (1 - l1_ratio) * 2 * theta[1:]
        gradients_weights = (1/m) * X_b[:, 1:].T.dot(error) + l1_grad + l2_grad
        
        # Update parameters
        theta[0] = theta[0] - learning_rate * gradient_intercept
        theta[1:] = theta[1:] - learning_rate * gradients_weights
        
        # Calculate cost with Elastic Net regularization
        mse = (1/(2*m)) * np.sum(np.square(error))
        l1_penalty = (alpha * l1_ratio/m) * np.sum(np.abs(theta[1:]))
        l2_penalty = (alpha * (1 - l1_ratio)/(2*m)) * np.sum(np.square(theta[1:]))
        cost = mse + l1_penalty + l2_penalty
        cost_history.append(cost)
        
    return theta, cost_history
```

## Early Stopping

Early stopping prevents overfitting by monitoring validation error and stopping training when it starts to increase. This technique leverages the observation that models typically fit the training data progressively better over time while their performance on unseen data eventually starts to degrade.

### Conceptual Understanding

Early stopping can be viewed as a form of implicit regularization:
- During initial training, the model learns general patterns that apply to both training and validation data
- Later in training, the model starts to memorize training examples (overfit), harming generalization

By stopping "early" when validation performance starts to deteriorate, we capture the model at its optimal generalization point.

## Early Stopping

Early stopping prevents overfitting by monitoring validation error and stopping training when it starts to increase.

```{python}
def gradient_descent_with_early_stopping(X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, learning_rate=0.01, max_iterations=1000, patience=5):
    m_train = X_train.shape[0]
    n_features = X_train.shape[1]
    theta = np.zeros((n_features + 1, 1))
    X_train_b = np.c_[np.ones((m_train, 1)), X_train]
    X_val_b = np.c_[np.ones((X_val.shape[0], 1)), X_val]
    
    train_cost_history = []
    val_cost_history = []
    
    best_val_cost = float('inf')
    best_theta = None
    patience_counter = 0
    
    for i in range(max_iterations):
        # Train step
        predictions = X_train_b.dot(theta)
        error = predictions - y_train
        gradients = (1/m_train) * X_train_b.T.dot(error)
        theta = theta - learning_rate * gradients
        
        # Calculate training cost
        train_cost = (1/(2*m_train)) * np.sum(np.square(error))
        train_cost_history.append(train_cost)
        
        # Calculate validation cost
        val_predictions = X_val_b.dot(theta)
        val_error = val_predictions - y_val
        val_cost = (1/(2*X_val.shape[0])) * np.sum(np.square(val_error))
        val_cost_history.append(val_cost)
        
        # Early stopping logic
        if val_cost < best_val_cost:
            best_val_cost = val_cost
            best_theta = theta.copy()
            patience_counter = 0
        else:
            patience_counter += 1
            
        if patience_counter >= patience:
            print(f"Early stopping at iteration {i}")
            break
            
    # Visualize training and validation costs
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(train_cost_history, label='Training Cost')
    plt.plot(val_cost_history, label='Validation Cost')
    plt.xlabel('Iterations')
    plt.ylabel('Cost')
    plt.title('Training and Validation Costs with Early Stopping')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()
    
    return best_theta, train_cost_history, val_cost_history
```

## Batch Normalization

Batch Normalization improves training by normalizing layer inputs, addressing issues like internal covariate shift and vanishing gradients.

```{python}
def batch_normalize(X, epsilon=1e-8):
    """Simple implementation of batch normalization for a mini-batch"""
    # Calculate mean and variance along the batch dimension
    batch_mean = np.mean(X, axis=0)
    batch_var = np.var(X, axis=0)
    
    # Normalize
    X_normalized = (X - batch_mean) / np.sqrt(batch_var + epsilon)
    
    # Parameters for scale and shift (in practice, these would be learned)
    gamma = np.ones(X.shape[1])
    beta = np.zeros(X.shape[1])
    
    # Scale and shift
    X_bn = gamma * X_normalized + beta
    
    return X_bn
```

# For regression
sgd_reg = SGDRegressor(max_iter=1000, tol=1e-3, penalty='l2', alpha=0.01, learning_rate='optimal')

# For classification
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
X_class, y_class = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, random_state=42)
X_train_class, X_test_class, y_train_class, y_test_class = train_test_split(X_class, y_class, test_size=0.2)

sgd_clf = SGDClassifier(max_iter=1000, tol=1e-3, penalty='l2', alpha=0.01, learning_rate='optimal')
sgd_clf.fit(X_train_class, y_train_class)
```

## Using TensorFlow/Keras

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD

# Create a simple model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    Dense(1)
])

# Configure the optimizer
optimizer = SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

# Train the model
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train, 
    epochs=100, 
    batch_size=32, 
    validation_split=0.2,
    verbose=0
)

# Plot the learning curves
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.title('Training Progress with SGD in TensorFlow/Keras')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
